    question: "What motivated you to this product?",
    answer:
      "Post Covid, we believe there is amongst people a significant increase in the awareness of the need to care for one's health. In a developing country like India the cost of health care for the common man is high and unaffordable. The Government has on its part embarked on an ambitious program Ayushmann Bharat to address some of the challenges faced by the common man, in terms of providing free drugs, diagnostics and insurance cover to the poor. One of the key focus areas of the Ayushmann Bharat initiative is Preventive Care and Early Detection of Diseases. The aim is to create awareness and urge people towards prevention rather than post disease care, which will significantly benefit people to stay healthy and prevent / reduce potential hospitalisation costs. According to reports published on health care, today, every 4th individual is likely to be hypertensive; modern life style changes affecting obesity; lack of awareness of the need for period basic health checks, shortage of qualified health care givers, etc amongst other factors will burden the health care industry. In India, one of the challenges people face is access to quality health care services such as doctors, access to even basic health parameter checks of say Vitals, etc. People in the rural areas are the worst affected. atmaParikshan+ is Swastha Technovations solution to address the need for initial assessment of a patients vitals in a non invasive manner with built in AI & IOT technologies, user friendly, with voice over instructions in the local language, especially in hospitals, clinics, primary health care centres both in urban and rural areas, we felt to bring a small change to the benefit of the common man",
