              atmaParikshan+ SwaSeva Hospital kiosk is a creative self-serving
              solution that reduces wait times for patients, reduces the burden

              Leading hospitals are faced with increasing patient footfalls. At
              times, the increase in footfalls tends to be non-linear and
              transient in nature, as experienced recently with Covid and
              similar events.
            </li>
            <li>
              Managing increased footfalls leads to challenges for the front
              desk and pre-consultation screening staff. Hospitals encounter
              difficult situations with Patients complaining about errors in
              registration data, the need to visit different units for basic
              tests of vitals and the delivery/receipt of lab reports prior to
              doctor consultation.
            </li>
            <li>
              In addition, many patients are not yet technology-savvy and do not
              have access to emails where reports are sent, and hence the need
              to print paper, deployment of resources remains.
            </li>
            <li>
              The need to address data errors, the ire of patients, increased
              footfalls, coupled with an increase in the cost of support is a
              challenge faced by many leading hospitals.
